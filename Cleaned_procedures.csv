Combined SHIRPA and Dysmorphology,SHIRPA and dysmorphology were originally always separate assessments.&nbsp; However they have recently been combined as assessments so that they take place at the same time.The purpose of the assessments is to examine mice for obvious physical characteristics behaviors and morphological abnormalities.Descriptions include abnormal locomotion/appearance/behavior/reflex reactions.,TRUE,31915

Hematology,Hematological assessment of blood determines blood cell counts (white blood cells red blood cells hemoglobin and platelets) and additional hematological parameters (hematocrit mean cell volume mean corpuscular hemoglobin mean cell hemoglobin concentration) can be derived using these indices. These tests will indicate abnormalities in the production of blood and its components (blood cells and hemoglobin) as well as in the associated blood-forming organs.&nbsp;Ontological description: MP:0002429 - abnormal blood cell morphology/development.,TRUE,21189
