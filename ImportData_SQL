How to import data into SQL

•	Both MySQL and DBeaver must allow you to import data - it is currently disabled.


1.	MySQL must say local_infile = ON,

On the SQL script type: 

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';

SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;

Output: local_infile | ON


2.	DBeaver’s MySQL driver must also allow it.

To do this: 

Right click Local host  - choose Edit Connections  - click  Driver Properties

You should see:

Property (Name)               Value
	
allowLoadLocalInfile	       true
allowLocalInfile	           true
allowUrlInLocalInfile	       true


Change this to: 

•	Inside Driver properties, scroll the list (or use the search box).
If the properties are missing, you must add them manually.

Add/change the following to true:

Property (Name)               Value
	
allowLoadLocalInfile	       true
allowLocalInfile	           true
allowUrlInLocalInfile	       true

How to add a property:
1.	Click Add Property (bottom right of the window)
2.	Enter the name (e.g., allowLoadLocalInfile)
3.	Hit Enter
4.	Enter the value true
5.	Hit Finish 

•	Restart you connection 

To Check it worked: 

TEST 1 — Run the MySQL variable check

In DBeaver, run this SQL:

SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';

If it returns:
local_infile | ON

Your MySQL server allows LOCAL INFILE.
If it shows OFF → server is blocking it (not DBeaver).


TEST 2 — Test the DBeaver + JDBC driver
Run this inside DBeaver:

SELECT @local_infile;

If result is 1, the client AND server both allow it.
If result is 0, then:

•	You added the driver property in the wrong place
OR
•	You didn’t restart the connection

    Was able to load data using this code: 

-- load data parameter description data into table--
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/Users/ayanabdillahi/Desktop/Group4 /Cleaned_parameter_description.csv' 
INTO TABLE Parameter_Description 
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS
(ImpcParameterOrigId, name, description, parameterId)

But it showed this output: Duplicate entry '' for key 'parameter_description.PRIMARY'
*Might need to change the code up a bit. 

    Imported data for Phenotype_Procedure

•	Had to increase the VARCHAR size because the procedure description was too long for the column. It exceeded 200 characters (the actual length was approximately 546).

#data too long for column
ALTER TABLE Phenotype_Procedure 
MODIFY description VARCHAR(600);

Then it was able to import .
